# tic-tac-toe

# DOM Project

In this activity, you will create a game using the DOM, HTML, and CSS.

## Objectives

- Directly manipulate the DOM by adding and removing elements.
- Use CSS to style elements on the page.
- Add event handlers to interact with user actions on the page.
- Manage game data in an organized and structured way, separate from the visual representation.
- Implement the game logic in an orderly and structured manner, dividing the code into as many functions as necessary.
- Separate the game logic from the visual code.

## Setup

- Run `npm install` to install Tailwind CSS.
- Run `npm start` to initialize the Tailwind CSS compiler.
- Open `index.html` in your browser using the Live Server extension in VS Code.

## Basic Requirements

- Develop the game using everything youâ€™ve learned about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the DOM.
- If you prefer, you can create another game.
- Create a grid for tic-tac-toe in `HTML`.
- The styling should resemble the image `pas3.PNG`.
- Use JavaScript to display "x" and "o" on the grid.
